# React Experiment 5: Express-based server with a React frontend that can serve static files

## Overview
    This React experiment focuses on exploring Express's static() method to have the server of this 
program be able to serve static files within a specified directory, such that the browser can display 
these static files when the user appends a relative path to these static files in the current browser 
URL! The program in this experiment will also have a React-based frontend to display the instructions 
on using this program!
