# Experiments with React

## Overview 
I will create new experiments to learn and experiment with various features that React has and the tools that are compatible with React. 
I will also record my findings in Markdown files for each experiment with what I have found when working on with these experiments. 

## Current Objective 
Investigate how to properly set up or create needed files for a React project. 

## Any Future Plans with this repository
I also have plans to create a gallery website primarily with React to showcase each individual experiments I have done so far. For now, 
I will save that until I have created at least 10 different React experiments, each with different websites created and maintained with React and 
all compatible tools for React.
