# React Experiment 2

## Overview
In this React experiment, I will demonstrate the efficient method of importing multiple components 
from one JavaScript file instead of from many JSX files. Thus, whenever I want to import 
specific components from somewhere, I know where to import it from based on the JavaScript file
inside the folder from the components I want to import and can use one line of code to import
all the specific components I need from that folder.
