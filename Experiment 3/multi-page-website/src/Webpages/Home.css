/* External CSS files to style the Home page! */

/* 
    Finding: The style applied for the Home component is also 
    applied for the About and Process components too, even if 
    there is no other background color specified in the External 
    CSS files for About and the Process component in their 
    respective About.jsx and Process.jsx files!

    Apparently, the styling can apply to all subcomponents 
    when the background color matches the specific selector 
    (element selector, class selector, and/or id selector)
*/

/* 
    Including another h1 selector with a different background color in About.css file,
    overrides this h1 lightcoral background color, regardless of order of importing and exporting components!
*/
h1{
    background-color: lightcoral;
}


/*
    Observation: I can influence the color of the HomeTitle component 
    from this Home.css file even though it's only imported in 
    Home.jsx file!
*/
h2{
    background-color: lightgreen;
}

/* 
    Theory: 
    1) Home.jsx component imports the HomeTitle component, 
    so the HomeTitle component is now encompassed in the Home.jsx component,
    so any applied styling for the Home page now also includes the 
    HomeTitle and all other components imported into Home.jsx file!

    2) The styling applied by Home.css file for the Home component
    are applied to the About and Process components, because they have
    matching h1 element selectors and the styling when imported by 
    App.jsx are also applied to all other components imported by App.jsx
    (which also included About and Process components)!
