# Experiment 1 

Going to explore using Vite to create a template React project, and then analyze the file structure of a typical React project such 
that we can find more quicker and efficient way of creating and setting up a React-based project! 

Status: Successfully created a new React application with starter code using Vite! 

## Creating a React Template Project with Vite

1) Open the terminal and navigate to the directory to create the project (React Project inside Experiment 1, for this example) 

2) Run this:
```
    npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```
* You can replace my-react-app with any desired name for your project 

3) You will get to use arrow commands and enters to select and confirm which framework and variant to use. 
* Framework: react
* Variant: JavaScript 

4) Navigate into the new React project directory that was created 
For this example: 
```
    cd my-react-app 
```

5) Install dependencies 
```
    npm install
```

6) Start the development server
```
    npm run dev 
```

7) There will be a clickable link to view the React project's front-end side, so click that link. 

8) If you want to continue adjusting changes or stop working, press Ctrl + C. You can start the development server again as in Step 6!
